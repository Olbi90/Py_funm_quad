# Py_funm_quad

Modular implementation of a quadrature-based restart Krylov method for the approximation of f(A)b.
A is a square, large and sparse matrix, b is a vector and f is a function.

In version 1.0 you can approximate the following functions:
- inverse squareroot
- exp
- log(1+A)/A [ where 1 is the identity ]


You can start py_funm_quad with a GUI:
